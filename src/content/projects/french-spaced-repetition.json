  "problem": "French learners needed a study aid that reinforces vocabulary at the right cadence instead of repeating random flashcards.",
  "approach": "Modeled each vocabulary card in a PostgreSQL-backed linked list and exposed a JWT-authenticated Node/Express API that reprioritizes cards after every attempt. The React client visualizes streaks, accuracy, and upcoming cards so learners understand where to focus next.",
  "results": [
    "Learners cycle through 40+ vocabulary cards without repetition fatigue",
    "API integration tests guard the spaced repetition algorithm from regressions",
    "Deployment on Vercel keeps latency low for practice sessions"
